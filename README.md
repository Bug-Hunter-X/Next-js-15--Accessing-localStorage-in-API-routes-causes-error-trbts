# Next.js 15: localStorage Error in API Routes

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using localStorage in Next.js 15 API routes or server-side functions.  The `about.js` file attempts to access localStorage directly, leading to an error when the page is rendered on the server.

## Problem

Attempting to access `localStorage` in a server-side rendering context, such as an API route or a `getStaticProps` function, results in an error because `localStorage` is not available on the server.  The server-side environment does not have the same browser context as the client-side environment, so there is no `localStorage` object available.

## Solution

The solution is to avoid directly accessing localStorage on the server-side. Instead, access localStorage only on the client-side, after the page has fully loaded in the browser.  The `aboutSolution.js` file demonstrates a corrected version that will handle this scenario.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You'll see the error.
5. Navigate to `/aboutsolution`. You'll see the correct behavior.
